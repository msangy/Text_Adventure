choice_prompt = "Press 1 to continue putting on your spacesuites and open the hatch to investigate. Press 2 to step back and head to the window to investigate: "
outcome_1 = "You're not able to see anything but notice that there are prints in the gra dirt leading around the back of the spacecraft."
outcome_2 = "As you approach the window, you see the end of a tail whip around the back of the spacecraft and immediately reach for your laser pistol from your hip."
